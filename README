Generates facter JSON output from various network configurations across facter
versions.

Why? Just like Puppet, Facter is a fast moving target and it's tough to keep up
with the changes. Also we needed some real-world examples of Facter output on
various configurations.

Have net-tools installed. Tested on CentOS 8 in a libvirt VM with two NICs
connected to the "default" network.

This is public domain.

Have fun.
